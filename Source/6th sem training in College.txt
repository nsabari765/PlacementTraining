--Number Logics--
1. odd or even(can we try to solve this program using gates(and or xor...).

	---Special Number--- (done)
	1. A two digit number whose addition and multiplication results the same number then the number is called special number.
	
	For Ex: 49 => 4+9 and 4*9 and add both and we get same actual number
	
	---Neon Number-- (done)
	Ex: 9^2 => 81 => 8 + 1 = 9 then it is neon number.
	
	---Armstrong Number--- (done)
	Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of power of length of acutal number.
	
	Ex: 153 => 1^3, 5^3, 3^3 (3 in power is lenght of acutal number) then add all numbers and we get acutal number.
	
	---Evil Number--- - done
	The number which have more than 2 ones in its binary format is known as evil number.
	
	---Automorphic Number--- - done
	Ex: 5^2 => 25, 76^2 => 5776
	
	---Pronic Number--- - done
	Ex: 6 => 2*3( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 the 6 is come product using within the set).
	
	---Spy Number--- - done
	Ex: 1+3+2 =6 and 1*3*2=6 then it is called as spy number.
	
	---Palindrome Number--- (done)
	Ex: 1441, 2002
	
	---Perfect Square Number--- - done
	Ex: 5*5
	
	---Strong Number--- - done
	Ex: 145 => 1! + 4! + 5! = 145 then it is called as strong number.
	
	---Abundant Number--- - done
	Ex: 12 => find factor of 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and add it to 16) 16 > 12 then it is abundant number.
	
	---Magic Number--- (done)
	Ex: 1729 => 1+7+2+9 = 19*91 = 1729
	
	---Disarium Number--- - done
	Note: Power of position of that specific number and add all that number.
	
	135 => 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 135.
	
	---Trimorphic Number--- - done
	The Number whose cube results of last digit is same as actual number.
	
	Ex: 5^3 => 125(last digit 5 is match with actual given number).
	
--Scenario based Querstion--
	input: 3521, 2452, 1352, 38
	

//30/12/2025

1. Wap to find 100th prime number? - done
2. wap to find 100th and 105th prime number? - done
3. Time limit 40 minutes limit time 10:00 am today.

--Recursion--
Note: A function itself call is known as recursion.
recursion works on principle of stack(LIFO).

---SizeOf()---
	
1. write the program to declare array for store the element and read the element. - done	
2. write a program to find sum of all array elements. - done
3. write a program avg of given array elements. - done
4. WAP to even number. - done
5. WAP to odd number. - done
6. WAP to find Prime Number. - done
7. WAP to find max element in given array. - done
8. WAP to find min element in given array. - done
9. WAP to find sum of all even number and all odd number and all prime number in given array. - done
10. WAP to reverse in the given array. - done

---Sorting---
Note: Ascending and descending order.

1. WAP to do right rotation of an array. - done(Need Optimize Solution)
2. WAP to do left rotation of an array. - done(Need Optimize Solution)
3. WAP to find how many unique values in a given array. - done
4. WAP to find how many duplicates in a given array.
5. WAP to find all prime number in a given array if any prime number there find max prime number.
6. WAP to find all prime number in a given array if any prime number there find min prime number.

---2D Array---

1. WAP to take inputs for user  given array size store and print the input. - done
2. WAP to print transpose of given matrix. - done
3. WAP to perform matrix multiplication only if it is eligible. - done
(Matrix multiplication is eligible only when the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.)
4. WAP to add rows, add cols, add diagonals and add anti diagonals. - done
5. WAP to add 2 matrix with respective cols. - done

---String---

Note: 1. Collection of Characters is known as string.
2. In String atlast null character is appended by compiler to make it End of string.
3. String supports indexing known as sub address.
4. Re declration of string is not allowed.
5. a = char[3] and re-Initialization is not allowed.
6. String doesn't support item assignment.
7. If the size of char array is 5 but we stored only 3 char then size of char array automatically changed to 3.
so size of the char depends on no. of chars given by user.

---ASCII Values---

1. 32 - Space.
2. 35 - #
3. 48 - 0
4. 65 - A
5. 97 - a

---Problem---
1. WAP to take input of a string store in an array and print that string.
2. WAP to count no. of vowels.
3. WAP to print length of each word in a sentance.
4. WAP to reverse each word.
5. WAP to count no. of words in a given input.
6. WAP to convert upper to lower and lower to upper.
7. WAP to convert the given input to upper case to lower case according to letter.
8. WAP to print alphatical order of given string.
9. WAP to find below logic
10. WAP to expand the given number. Eg: 35 -> 30 + 5, 132 -> 100 + 30 + 2.
11. WAP to remove duplicates digits from the given number. Eg: 1334 -> 134.
12. WAP to sort the given words.
